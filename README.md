# web-dev-projects

**NOTE:** The tip-tax project has been duplicated into another repository so it could be easily deployed to AWS Amplify.

This repo contains all the projects I have worked on related to web development.

Most of the "projects" here are simply the result of following along with various
online courses, including Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller's React guide on Udemy and
Cory House's React and Redux guide on Pluralsight. Below is a list of all these
code-along projects; everything else is my own work.

## Code-along projects:

- udemy-react-guide
- burger-builder-app
